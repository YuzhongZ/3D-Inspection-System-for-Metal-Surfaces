# 3D-Inspection-System-for-Metal-Surfaces

This project entails a 3D Inspection System designed for detecting and localizing defects on metal surfaces. The '3D-measurement' folder contains code for segmenting and extracting 3D point clouds, along with an interactive interface for labeling the 3D data. The defect detection is achieved using the AST model.
